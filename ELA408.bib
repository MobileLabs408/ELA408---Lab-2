	abstract = {Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) is a widely used technique in autonomous mobile robots. This study deals with the estimation of localizability, which indicates the reliability of localization at each location on the occupancy grid maps created by SLAM. There are several approaches to estimate localizability, this paper proposes a method using local map correlation. Our method represents the localizability using a covariance matrix of a Gaussian distribution, not just a scalar value. The simulation experiment results showed that the uncertainty of localizability increased at locations where degeneration is likely to occur, suggesting that localizability could be estimated appropriately.},

	abstract = {This research focuses on mapping at indoor environment where differential drive mobile robots are used as a vehicle. The unknown environment to robots is a problem in robotics, therefore the grid map occupancy method was used as mapping method in unknown environment, so that robots can represent the results of environmental mapping using LIDAR sensors to a 2D map. The experiment done by the mobile robot was equipped with a LIDAR sensor as a sensor for retrieving data around the robot where the robot was instructed to explore the corridor inside a building and do mapping in real time. After experiment done, this method successfully mapped the environment around the robot with an average mapping error 6.05 cm.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose an optimization based SLAM approach to simultaneously optimize the robot trajectory and the occupancy map using 2D laser scans (and odometry) information. The key novelty is that the robot poses and the occupancy map are optimized together, which is significantly different from existing occupancy mapping strategies where the robot poses need to be obtained first before the map can be estimated. In our formulation, the map is represented as a continuous occupancy map where each 2D point in the environment has a corresponding evidence value. The Occupancy-SLAM problem is formulated as an optimization problem where the variables include all the robot poses and the occupancy values at the selected discrete grid cell nodes. We propose a variation of Gauss-Newton method to solve this new formulated problem, obtaining the optimized occupancy map and robot trajectory together with their uncertainties. Our algorithm is an offline approach since it is based on batch optimization and the number of variables involved is large. Evaluations using simulations and publicly available practical 2D laser datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach can estimate the maps and robot trajectories more accurately than the state-of-the-art techniques, when a relatively accurate initial guess is provided to our algorithm. The video shows the convergence process of the proposed OccupancySLAM and comparison of results to Cartographer can be found at https://youtu.be/4oLyVEUC4iY.},

	abstract = {Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) is an active localization method for Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV), and it can mainly be used in unknown and complex areas such as coastal water, harbors, and wharfs. This paper presents a practical occupancy grid-based method based on forward-looking sonar for AUV. The algorithm uses an extended Kalman filter (EKF) to estimate the AUV motion states. First, the SLAM method fuses the data coming from the navigation sensors to predict the motion states. Subsequently, a novel particle swarm optimization genetic algorithm (PSO-GA) scan matching method is employed for matching the sonar scan data and grid map, and the matching pose would be used to correct the prediction states. Lastly, the estimated motion states and sonar scan data would be used to update the grid map. The experimental results based on the field data have validated that the proposed SLAM algorithm is adaptable to underwater conditions, and accurate enough to use for ocean engineering practical applications.},
